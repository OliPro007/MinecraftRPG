As soon as my mod become advanced enough to be released in 1.6.4 and most popular mods from FTB reach 1.7, I will transpose my code here for 1.7.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe idea of an RPG came from the plugin mcmmo on bukkit. I find it very interesting to have experience and some abilities for mining, diging, fishing, fighting, etc. I will try to create a similar system on forge that can be used both in singleplayer and multiplayer. I also have a little \"fantasy\" of guns in minecraft. It is the first (and only) thing I have developped. I'll put the code here as suggested Pahimar in his new tutorial, and left it public for anyone to leave me some suggestions of ideas or codes, or simply for help.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>\r\nThank you for your interest in my project!\r\n</h3>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
